Day 1 challenge 1:
Write a function called map which takes an array and a function as arguments. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the function applied to each element.

So here we want to take an Array [x, y, z] and a Function (x => ())
Then we will apply the Function to the Array 
and using .map keep track of the results when the function is called
this will return a new Array containing the new results
